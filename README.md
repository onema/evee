Summary
_______

This is a port for Python `v3.3+` of the Symfony Event Dispatcher `v3.0`.

This event dispatcher follows a pattern called the ["Mediator" pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/mediator).

> In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.
